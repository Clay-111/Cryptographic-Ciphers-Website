# Cryptographic Ciphers Website

This project is a web-based application that allows users to perform various cryptographic operations using different ciphers. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Additive Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt text using the additive cipher.
- **Multiplicative Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt text using the multiplicative cipher.
- **Affine Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt text using the affine cipher.
- **Autokey Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt text using the autokey cipher.
- **Vigenere Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt text using the Vigenere cipher.
- **RailFence Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt text using the railfence cipher.

## Project Structure

- `cyber.css`: Contains the styles for the web application.
- `cyber.js`: Contains the JavaScript functions for performing cryptographic operations.
- `main.html`: The main HTML file that includes the form for user input and displays the output.

## Usage

1. Open `main.html` in a web browser.
2. Select a cipher from the "Select Cipher" dropdown.
3. Select an operation (Encryption or Decryption) from the "Select Operation" dropdown.
4. Enter the required key(s) and text.
5. Click the "Output" button to see the result.

## Example

To encrypt the text "hello" using the Additive cipher with the key "b":

1. Select "Additive" from the "Select Cipher" dropdown.
2. Select "Encryption" from the "Select Operation" dropdown.
3. Enter "b" in the "Enter Key(1)" field.
4. Enter "hello" in the "Enter Text" field.
5. Click the "Output" button to see the encrypted text.
